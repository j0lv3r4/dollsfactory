					<p class="lead">Dolls Factory is a makeup project that started ten years ago in Mexico and still continues in The Woodlands, TX.</p>

					<p class="lead">In 2004 I graduated from Cosmetology and Professional Makeup in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Since then, I've met the most incredible people and visited gorgeous locations, gaining experience with the collaboration between my clients' needs, expectations and my passion for makeup.</p>

					<p class="lead">Before each session I like to listen carefully about what they need, their worries, their expectations and how we can get the best of each other during that time. I love to think that each finished makeup is the start or a continuation of a relationship and I try to live up to that.</p>

					<p class="lead">Don't hesitate to contact me if you think we could make a good match, or if you have any question about makeup without any obligation, or just to say hi, I'd love to hear about you.</p>
